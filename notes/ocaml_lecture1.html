# OCaml
	
Caml is a dialect of the ML programming language family, developed in France at INRIA. OCaml is the main implementation of the programming language Caml. The features of ML include:

- First-class functions
	- Functions can be data, too: parameters and return values
- Favor immutability (“assign once”)
- Data types and pattern matching
	- Convenient for certain kinds of data structures
- Type inference
	- No need to write types in the source language
		- But the language is statically typed
	- Supports parametric polymorphism
		- Generics in Java, templates in C++
- Exceptions
- Garbage collection

### Working with OCaml
  
- OCaml programs can be compiled using ocamlc
	- Produces .cmo (“compiled object”) and .cmi (“compiled interface”) files
	- Use -o to set output file name
	- Use -c to compile only to .cmo/.cmi and not to link
- Can also compile with ocamlopt
	- Produces .cmx files, which contain native code
	- Faster, but not platform-independent (or as easily debugged)

hello.ml:
  
	(* A small OCaml program *)
	print_string "Hello world!\n";;

To compile and run

	ocamlc hello.ml
	./a.out
	Hello world!

### Working with multiple files

 main.ml
 
 	let main () =
  		print_int (Util.add 10 20);
  		print_string "\n"

	let () = main ()

util.ml

 	 let add x y = x+y
Compile and run:

    ocamlc util.ml main.ml

Or compile separately
	
	ocamlc –c util.ml
	ocamlc util.cmo main.ml

To execute

	./a.out

Use ocamlbuild to compile larger projects and automatically. OCamlbuild finds dependencies. To build a bytecode executable out of main.ml and its local dependencies
	
	ocamlbuild main.byte

The executable main.byte is in _build folder. To execute:
	
 	./main.byte

OCaml topleve, a REPL for OCaml
  
     ocaml
	     OCaml version 4.04.0
	# print_string ”Hello world!\n";;
    	Hello world!
     - : unit = ()
	
To load a file into top level:
	
	#use “filename.ml”

	
To exit the top-level,  type ^D (Control D) or call the exit 0
	# exit 0;;


### First OCaml Example  

	(* A small OCaml program (* with nested comments *) *)
	let x = 37;;
	let y = x + 5;;
	print_int y;;
	print_string "\n";;


OCaml is strictly typed

	print_int 10;;
		10- : unit = ()
Following expressions do not type check
		
	print_int 10.5;;
		Error: This expression has type float but an expression was expected of type int
    
    1 + 0.5;;
		Error: This expression has type float but an expression was expected of type int
                   
	print_int "This function expected an int";;
		Error: This expression has type string but an expression was expected of type int


	1 + true;;
		Error: This expression has type bool but an expression was expected of type int
 

### if statement
	
	if e1 then e2 else e3
Type checking rules
	
	- if e1 : bool and e2 : t and e3 : t then 
		- if e1 then e2 else e3 : t
Examples:
			
 	if 7 > 42 then "hello" else "goodbye";;
		- : string = "goodbye"


	if 7 > 42 then "hello" else 10;;
		Error: This expression has type int but an expression was expected of type string

An expression is a value

	print_int (if 10>5 then 100 else 200);;
	100- : unit = ()

### Functions

We use let to define a function:

Factorial function:

	let rec fact n =
 	 if n = 0 then
     	1
  	else
     	n * fact (n-1);;

Next integer

	let next x = x + 1;;

Swapping two values
	
	let swap (x,y) = (y,x);;

Adding two integers
	
	let add x y = x + y;;
	
Comparing other types

	let eq (x,y) = x = y;; (* = is polymorphic *)

### Function types:  
-> (arraow) is the function type constructor

	let next x = x + 1;;
		val next : int -> int = <fun>

	let fn x = (int_of_float x) * 3;;
		val fn : float -> int = <fun>
		
	fact;;
	 - : int -> int = <fun>

### Calling Functions

 	let rec fact n =
  		if n = 0 then
  			1
  		else
     		n * fact (n-1)

	fact 2 
	if 2=0 then 1 else 2*fact(2-1)
	2 * fact 1
	2 * (if 1=0 then 1 else 1*fact(1-1))
	2 * 1 * fact 0
	2 * 1 * (if 0=0 then 1 else 0*fact(0-1))
	2 * 1 * 1
	2

### Type annotations
  
    let (x : int) = 3;;
		val x : int = 3
    
    let fn (x:int):float = (float_of_int x) *. 3.14;;
		val fn : int -> float = <fun>
		
### List
An OCaml list is an immutable, finite sequence of elements of the same type. List is a primitive data type
	
	[1;2;3];;     
 
Nested lists

	[ [1;2]; [3;4] ]

empty list

	[];;             

What are the types of the above lists?

	[1;2;3];;    
		- : int list = [1; 2; 3]

	[ [1;2]; [3;4] ];;
		- : int list list = [[1; 2]; [3; 4]]

	[];; 
		- : 'a list = []
		
### Constructing lists
OCaml lists can be constructed using :: notation. 

	3 :: [];;
		- : int list = [3]
		
	2 :: (3 :: []);;
		- : int list = [2; 3]

	1::2::3::[];;
		- : int list = [1; 2; 3]


### Type checking rules

	if e1 : t and e2 : t list then e1::e2 : t list

Example:

	let x = [1;2;3];;
	let y = 4 :: x;;
	val y : int list = [4; 1; 2; 3]

	let y = x :: 4;;   (* does not work; "A :: B" means that  B should be a list containing whatever type A is *)



More list type practice

	[[[]; []; [1.3;2.4]]];;
		- : float list list list = [[[]; []; [1.3; 2.4]]]

	[1; 2; "lists must be homogeneous"];;
		Error: This expression has type string but an expression was expected of type
         int

	[1, 2, 3];;  (* probably not what you expect; this list has _one_ element *)
		(int * int * int) list = [(1, 2, 3)]
[1, 2, 3] is same as [(1,2,3)], a list of 3-tuple with type (int \* int \* int).

	[1;2] :: 3   (* expects a list on the right of :: *)

	Error: This expression has type int but an expression was expected of type
         int list list
