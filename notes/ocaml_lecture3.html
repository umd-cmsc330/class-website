### Pattern matching review

implement xor

	let xorb a b =
		match a with
		|true -> not b
		|_ -> b;;

Pattern matching detects missed cases. 


	let f l = match l with x::(y::_) -> x + y ;;
		Warning 8: this pattern-matching is not exhaustive.
		Here is an example of a case that is not matched:
		(_::[]|[])
	
	val f : int list -> int = <fun>

	f [1;2;3;4];;
	- : int = 3

	f [];;
	Exception: Match_failure
	
Pattern matching also detecs unused cases. Following example adds two integer list into one list.

	let rec add_list a b = 
	  match (a,b) with
		((h1::t1),(h2::t2))->h1+h2 :: (add_list t1 t2)
		|[],x ->x
		|x,[] -> x
		|_->[]
		;;
 		Warning 11: this match case is unused.
		val add_list : int list -> int list -> int list = <fun>
	
Because it never reaches the catch all case, pattern matching gives warnings. Removing the last catch all case will fix it.

	let rec add_list a b = 
	  match (a,b) with
		((h1::t1),(h2::t2))->h1+h2 :: (add_list t1 t2)
		|[],x ->x
		|x,[] -> x
		;;
	
		val add_list : int list -> int list -> int list = <fun>
		add_list [1;2;3] [4;5;6;7;8];;
		- : int list = [5; 7; 9; 7; 8]


### Mutual recursion
There are no "forward prototypes" in OCaml. But there is a special syntax for defining a set of two or more mutually recursive functions. We can write mutually recursive functions by putting them togeterh with a "and" keyword. You can also use similar syntax for writing mutually recursive class definitions and modules. Here is an example:


   	let rec even n =
			match n with
			| 0 -> true
			| x -> odd (x-1)
  	and odd n =
			match n with
			| 0 -> false
			| x -> even (x-1)
	;;
		val even : int -> bool = <fun>
		val odd : int -> bool = <fun>
Here is the another version that handles negative numers:

	let rec even n =
		if n < 0 then failwith "Argument Error" else
			match n with
			| 0 -> true
			| x -> odd (x-1)
  	and odd n =
		if n < 0 then failwith "Argument Error" else
			match n with
			| 0 -> false
			| x -> even (x-1)
	;;
		val even : int -> bool = <fun>
		val odd : int -> bool = <fun>


 ### Tuples
OCaml tuple is like a fixed lengthlist. But elements of a tuple can have different types. The type of an
n-tuple is written as an ordered sequence of n types, separated by *.
We construct a tuple by listing the elements in (e1,.....en) format and deconstruct using pattern matching.

	(1,2,3);;
		- : int * int * int = (1, 2, 3)
		
Tuples can be heterogeneous

	(1,3.5,"hello");;
		- : int * float * string = (1, 3.5, "hello")

Functions can take tuples as arguments

	let plusthree (x,y,z) = x + y + z

	let sum (a,b) = a + b

	let addone (x,y,z) = (x+1,y+1,z+1)
		
Tuple List

	[(1,1);(2,3);(1,5)]
	[(1,"alice");(2,"bob")]


###    Polymorphic types

Some functions work for any data type. Examples of polymorphic functions:

	let tl (_::t) = t

	let swap (x,y) = (y,x)

	let tls(_::xs, _::ys) = (xs, ys)

	let eq(x,y) = x = y     (* how do you parse this? *)



### Anonymous functions
An anonymous function is a function that is declared without being named. The fun expression creates an anonymous function.

	(fun x->x*2) 10        returns 20

bind anonymous functions to a variable

		let add = (fun x->x+1)

More examples

	let plus3 x = x+3;;
	let twice f x = f (f x);;
	let t f x = f (f (f x));;


	add x y = x + y
	((add x) y )
	let add x y = x+y
	let add = (fun x->(fun y->x+y))

### Higher order functions

What do these functions have in common?

	let rec neg x =
	  match x with
		  [] -> []
		| h::t -> (-h)::(neg t)
	;;

	let rec add1 x =
	  match x with
		  [] -> []
		| h::t -> (h+1)::(add1 t)
	;;

They both create a new list whose elements are a function of the corresponding elements in the old list. We can write this pattern as its own function, map. 
	
	map f [a;b;c;d] will generate a list [f a; f b; f c; f d]
map takes a function and a list as arguments, and generate a new list by applying the function to each memeber of the list.

	(* equivalent to List.map *)
	let rec map f x = 
	  match x with
		  [] -> []
		| h::t -> (f h)::(map f t)
	;;

	
	map (fun x->x*2) [10;20;30;40];;
		- : int list = [20; 40; 60; 80]

	
	let halve x = x / 2;;
 	map halve [10;20;30;40];;
		- : int list = [5; 10; 15; 20]
  
More Examples
  
 	let neg' x = (* the same as neg *)
	  let negate y = -y in
	map negate x
	;;

	let add1' x = (* the same as add1 *)
	  let addone y = y + 1 in
	  map addone x;;

	neg [1;2;3] = neg' [1;2;3];;
	add1 [1;2;3] = add1' [1;2;3];;
