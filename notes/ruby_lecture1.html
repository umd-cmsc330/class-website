## Lecture 1   Ruby

## classes abd Objects

### How to execute Ruby Program
- Use the ruby interpreter
 `ruby -w example.rb`
- Use the interactive shell
 `irb`		quit/exit to stop
- Eclipse Ruby plugin
- Add #! /bin/ruby to the ruby program and change mode to executable
 `chmod a+x x.rb`


### Editor
	Any text editor is good. We use Emacs in class

	
### Ruby classes

Everything is an object in Ruby. Every variable is a reference to an object.
	
	1.class
	=> Integer
	

1 is an instance of the Integer class

	1473638940575746746362202020.class
	=> Integer
	
1473638940575746746362202020 is an Integer

	"hello".class
	=> String	
"hello" is a String object.
	
	true.class
		=> TrueClass
	false.class
		=> FalseClass
	nil.class
		=> NilClass

	
	nil.nil?
		=> true

	
nil.nil? returns true. nil is an object and it has a method nil?

	0.nil?
		=> false
	

0.nil?	returns false because 0 is not nil.
	
Fun story: Jennifer Null BBC story

	In Ruby,  only false and nil are false. Everything is not false. 0 is not false
	
###Classes are objects too.
	1.class.class
		=> Class

The class of Class is Class.
	
	1.class.superclass
		=> Numeric

Super class of Integer is Numeric. All the ancestors of Integer
	1.class.ancestors
		=> [Integer, Numeric, Comparable, Object, Kernel, BasicObject]
	
	1.class.ancestors			#[Integer, Numeric, Comparable, Object, Kernel, BasicObject]
	
Object is the superclass of every class. 

	self.class
		=> Object

irb top level is an object of Object

top level functions are added to Object class
	
	def foo
		"CMSC330 Fall 2017"
	end
	
self.methods will list the method "anwar". Now, all ruby objects will have a method "foo".
	
	1.foo
		=> "CMSC330 Fall 2017"

	nil.foo
		=> "CMSC330 Fall 2017"
	
We can dynamically add methods to existing classes

	1.double
		NoMethodError: undefined method `double' for 1:Integer	
Integer does not have a method called "double". Now, we can add it.
	
	class Integer
		def double
			self + self
		end
	end
	
Now, all old and new objects of Integer class have a method "double"
	
	10.double
		=> 20

	
We can also remove methods from classes too
	
	remove_method :method_name
removes the method from child. Parent classes will still have the method.

	class Integer
		remove_method :to_s
	end	
Integer class' to_s method is deleted.  But Ruby still searches for the "to_s" from paretns and mixins.	

	1.to_s
		=> "\#< Integer:0x00000000000003 >" 
For Integer objects, to_s of Object is called.
	
	class Integer
		remove_method :double
	end
The method "double" is removed from Integer class.
						
	undef_method :method_name

prevents current class from responding any calls to :method_name. It undefines a method from a class and superclasses

	1.object_id
		=> 3

	class Integer
		undef_method :object_id
	end
	warning: undefining 'object_id' may cause serious problems	
			
	1.object_id
		NoMethodError: undefined method 'object_id' for 1:Integer

	
	
Another example:

	1.size
		=> 8
	
	class Integer
		undef_method:size
	end
	
	1.size
		NoMethodError: undefined method 'size' for 1:Integer
	
	
quitting irb and start again will fix the problem

We can even redefine existing methods
	
	class Integer 
		def +(a)
			1			
		end
	end
All integer additions return 1

	10+20
		=> 1

10+20 returns 1. This may break irb, because irb is written in Ruby.
	
	
remove_method and undef_method example:
	
	class Parent
  		def hello
    		puts "In parent"
  		end
	end
	class Child &lt; Parent
  		def hello
    		puts "In child"
  		end
	end

	c = Child.new
	c.hello

	class Child
  		remove_method :hello  # remove from child, still in parent
	end
	c.hello			#returns In parent

	class Child
  		undef_method :hello   # prevent any calls to 'hello'
	end
	
	c.hello			#undefined method `hello'
	
	
	

#Defining classes

	class class_name
		...
	end
	
Let us define a class Hello with one method.

	class Hello
	  	def my_first_method
    		puts "Hello, World!"
  		end
	end

	x = Hello.new
	x.my_first_method
returns
	
		Hello, World!
		=> nil
=> nil is the outpus of puts.

A class example

	class Point
      def x=(x)			#setX method
           @x = x
      end
    
      def x				#getX method
      	  @x
      end
      def y=(y)
           @y = y
      end
    
      def y
      	  @y
      end
      # make the method prt private
      private
      def prt
      	  "(#{@x}, #{@y})"
      end
      #Make the below methods public
      public 
      def to_s
      	  prt
      end
	end


In Point class, x= and y= are getters and x and y are setters.
	
	p = Point.new
	p.x= 100		# p.x = 100 is a syntactic sugar
	p.y = 200
	puts p.inspect
	puts p
The output:
	
	#<Point:0x007ffbfa10ed40 @x=100, @y=200>
	(100, 200)
### attr_accessor

	class Point
      attr_accessor :x, :y
      # make the method prt private
      private
      def prt
      	  "#{@x}, #{@y}"
      end
      #Make the below methods public
      public 
      def to_s
      	  prt
      end
	end


### class variables  @@variables

	class Person
		  @@count = 0
		  def initialize(name)
			  @name = name
					@@count += 1
		 end
		 def self.count
			 @@count
		 end
	end


	p = Person.new("anwar")

	Person.count	#returns 1 

	p = Person.new("anwar")
	p = Person.new("anwar")

	Person.count    #returns 3


### mixins
 
- include Comparable 
- spaceship operator <=>
- Fraction class
- stuff that we did not cover in class



### returning self is convenient for "stringing method calls"

  	class C
	  def m1
		print "hi "
		self
	  end
	  def m2
		print "bye "
		self
	  end
	  def m3
		print "\n"
		self
	  end
	end


	c = C.new
	c.m1.m2.m3.m1.m1.m3

Another example

	class D
	  def m1
		@foo = 0
	  end

	  def m2 x
		@foo += x
	  end

	  def foo
		@foo
	  end

	end


Example:

	class E 
	  # uses initialize method, which is better than m1
	  # initialize can take arguments too (here providing defaults)
	  def initialize(f=0)
		@foo = f
	  end

	  def m2 x
		@foo += x
	  end

	  def foo
		@foo
	  end

	end




### subclass overrides the method in the base class if the method name is same. 

	class A
      def m1(x)
      	  x
      end
	end

	class B < A
      #m1 overrides m1 in A although they have different argument list
      def m1(x,y)
      	  x+y
      end
	end





### visibility
	private
	ptotected
	public
