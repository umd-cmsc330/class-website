  <p>Office Hours</p>
  <p>There are over 600 students in this class, and because of this office  hours tend to get fairly crowded, especially the day(s) before a  project is due.  To prevent the OH room from getting excessively  crowded, we are establishing a few policies for office hours:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Students will have 3 tokens for office hours per day.  Once you  run out of tokens, you will not be able to join the queue until the  following day.</li>
    <li>Students are NOT allowed to "camp out" in the  office hours room.  Once you are helped, you must leave the office hours  room.  If you want to get back on the queue, then you may come back</li>
    <li>We  will be making our best attempt to limit our time with each student to 5  minutes.  Obviously, in some cases this will not be possible, but we  aren't going to sit with you for extended periods of time and help you  debug your code.  Since your time with the TAs is limited, <strong>be sure to have a clear understanding of your problem before joining the queue</strong>.   You should be able to answer questions like "what have you tried?" and  "what line is the error on?"  If you can answer these questions, the 5  minutes we can spend with you will be much more productive.  If your  question is more conceptual, you should be more specific than just  asking "where do I start?"</li>
    <li>If we call your name and you aren't there, we will dequeue you and move on.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>TAs will be enforcing these rules at all times, but especially when  office hours are crowded.  If a TA asks you to leave and you are not on  the queue, you must do so.</p>
  
  <p>Finally, when you join the queue, please specify a specific "topic".   Something like "I'm having trouble with public test X" or "submission  problem" is much more helpful than just saying "project 1".  It will  also help you make sure you know exactly what your problem is.</p>

  <p>
    We will be using the Zoom and Quuly platform to conduct office hours.

Here is how it works:

    Go to https://umd.zoom.us/ and sign in. I find the app works better instead of just doing everything through browser. Please sign in using CAS. This may require you to use your *@umd.edu email.
    Once you have the application installed, you should open the application and there there should be a couple of options. Select "New Meeting"
    Once the meeting room is made, there should be a button on the bottom row, that says "invite." Click that. A pop-up window should, well, pop-up. On the bottom left hand side of this new window, there is a "Copy Invitation" button. Click that. You should now have a link copied to your keyboard. Save it, because you'll need it for later.
    Open the office hours app and add yourself to the queue. When filling out the problem description field, TELL US YOUR PROBLEM and also paste that invitation link you copied.

Now all you have to do is wait for a TA to dequeue you, they will click that link, and they will then join the meeting you are hosting. When we have finished helping you, the TA will leave the room. Due to this system, it is vital that you add the zoom link. If you add a link to other software, or do not add the zoom link, we will mark you as a no-show. So don't do that.

    This does require you keep the meeting on and in the background so the link works when a TA dequeues you. We also ask you be alert and aware when you are dequeued because if we join a meeting and you are not available, we will have to move on to the next student.
