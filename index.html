            <p> Grades will be maintained on the CS Department <a
								 href="https://grades.cs.umd.edu">grades</a> server. You
              can always see your current grade here. </p>
            <p> You are responsible for all material discussed in
              lecture and discussion section and posted on the class web
              page, including announcements, deadlines, policies, etc.
              During the semester we may provide ungraded practice
              homework exercises and solutions. While we will not
              collect these exercises, completing them is essential
              preparation for exams. You may work together on these
              ungraded homeworks, and you may of course come to office
              hours for additional help. </p>
            <p> Your final course grade will be determined according to

            <p> Any request for reconsideration of any grading on
              coursework <strong>must</strong> be submitted within <strong>one




                week</strong> of when it is returned (or published on
              gradescope). Exam regrading requests must be made through
              gradecscope. Any coursework submitted for reconsideration
              may be regraded in its entirety, which could result in a
              lower score if warranted. </p>
            <p> Final course grades will be curved as necessary, based
              on each student's total num score for all coursework at
              the end of the semester. <strong>But</strong>: It is very
              likely that 90 and above earns an A, 80-90 earns a B,
              70-80 earns a C, etc.; the curve will only lower the
              cutoffs, not raise them. <strong>Important:</strong>
              Completing the programming assignments is an essential
              part of the course. Therefore, <strong>we may fail any
                student who does not make a good-faith attempt on all
                course projects</strong>, regardless of the student's
              performance or scores on the other coursework. We will
              define good-faith attempt as achieving at least 20 percent
              on the gradescope server for each project. To obtain these
              points you may submit solutions past the late deadline. </p>
            <h3>Programming Projects</h3>
            <p> Projects must be submitted electronically following the
              instructions given in class. Projects <strong>may not</strong>
              be submitted by any other means (e.g., please do not email
              your projects to us). It is <strong>your responsibility</strong>
              to test your program and <strong>verify that it works
                properly</strong> before submitting. All projects are
              due at 11:59pm on the day indicated on the project
              assignment, according to the gradescope server's internal
              clock. </p>
            <p> Projects may be submitted up to 24 hours late for a 10%
              penalty. For example, a project that would earn 90 points
              for an on-time submission will earn 81 (which is 90 times
              0.90) if submitted late. Note that your project score as
              it appears on the project submission (gradescope) server will not
              include any late penalties. Any penalties will be
              incorporated into the final project grade on the grade
              server. If you submit both on-time &amp; late, your
              project will receive the maximum of the penalty-adjusted
              scores. </p>
            <p> Project extensions will not be granted due to system
              problems, network problems, power outages, etc., so do not
              wait to submit a project until the night it is due. You
              may submit multiple times up to the deadline, and only
              your <strong>last on-time submission is graded</strong>.
              Similarly, if you submit late, only your <strong>last
                submission before the deadline will be graded</strong>.
              No consideration in grading will be made for errors made
              in transferring files or submitting the wrong version of
              your project. Having a working, unsubmitted version will
              not count; only submitted code will be counted. </p>
            <p><strong>Your projects will be graded based on test cases
                not provided in advance.</strong> Because grading is
              done automatically, you must follow the project
              specification exactly. Also, while projects will generally
              not be graded on style or documentation, we reserve the
              right to manually grade program source code for some
              projects. </p>
            <p> Finally, any "hard coding" in a project assignment may
              result in a score of zero for that project, and is
              considered a bad-faith effort. Hard coding refers to
              attempting to make a program appear as if it works
              correctly, when in fact it does not. One example of hard
              coding would be printing the desired output instead of
              computing it. This is only one example, and if you have
              any questions as to what constitutes hard coding, be sure
              to ask ahead of time. </p>
            <p> Do not share or publicly post your project solutions
              on-line; doing so constitutes a violation of academic
              integrity. This issue is discussed in greater detail
              below. </p>
            <h3>Clicker Quizzes</h3>
            <p> Clicker quizzes will be given in-class during lectures.
              Effective August 22, 2017, students and faculty at UMD
              have access to TurningPoint (Clickers) mobile license
              subscriptions at NO cost. You can use the phone app. You also have to register your
              device. Please follow the instructions here:<a href="https://umd.service-now.com/itsupport?id=kb_article&article=KB0012748&sys_kb_id=d6317b83db8f10504cb035623996198a">Instructions</a>

            <h3>Outside-of-class communication with course staff</h3>
            <p> We will interact with students outside of class in
              primarily three ways: in-person during office hours,
              electronically via the web forum and course web page, and
              electronically via e-mail. The large majority of
              communication should employ the first two methods,
              reserving e-mail for personal (presumably rare)
              circumstances. </p>
            <p> Personalized assistance, e.g., with programming
              assignments or exam preparation, will be provided during
              office hours. You are responsible for developing and
              debugging your own programs. Do not rely on the
              instructional staff to make your project work. Lower-level
              CMSC courses provide extensive debugging and development
              help in office hours, but upper-level CMSC courses expect
              students to complete projects with minimal extra help.
              Therefore in CMSC 330, we will provide less debugging help
              than some students may be used to. If you come in with a
              question, expect to be pointed in the right direction, but
              it will be up to you to finish solving the problem on your
              own. Office hours for the instructional staff will be
              posted on the course web page a few days into the
              semester. </p>
            <p> Additional assistance will provided via the <a
							      href="https://piazza.com/umd/fall2020/cmsc330">Piazza
                web forum</a>. You may use this forum to ask general
              questions of interest to the class as a whole, e.g.,
              administrative issues or project clarification questions.
              The course staff will monitor piazza on a daily basis, but
              do not expect immediate answers to questions. Please do
              not post publicly any information that would violate the
              university academic integrity policy (e.g., project code
              or test cases). </p>
            <p> Piazza allows students to post private questions that
              are only visible to instructors. Please use this feature
              if you wish to ask specific questions concerning your
              project solutions. Generally it will also be helpful to
              submit your current project code to the submit server, so
              instructors &amp; TAs can try running your code on their
              machines before answering your questions. </p>
            <p> Personal e-mail to instructors or TAs should be reserved
              for issues that <em>cannot</em> be handled by the above
              methods. </p>
            <p> Important announcements will be made in class or on the
              class web page, and via piazza. </p>
            <h3>Excused Absences</h3>
            <p> Any student who needs to be excused for an absence from
              a single <strong>lecture, recitation, or lab</strong> due
              to illness shall: </p>
            <ol>
              <li> Make a reasonable attempt to inform the instructor of
                his/her illness prior to the class.</li>
              <li> Upon returning to the class, present their instructor
                with a self-signed note attesting to the date of their
                illness. Each note must contain an acknowledgment by the
                student that the information provided is true and
                correct. Providing false information to University
                officials is prohibited under Part 9(h) of the Code of
                Student Conduct (V-1.00(B) University of Maryland Code
                of Student Conduct) and may result in disciplinary
                action.</li>
            </ol>
            <p> Missing an <strong> exam</strong> for reasons such as
              illness, religious observance, participation in required
              university activities, or family or personal emergency
              (such as a serious automobile accident or close relative's
              funeral) will be excused so long as the absence is
              requested in writing at least <strong> 2 days</strong> in
              advance and the student includes documentation that shows
              the absence qualifies as excused; <strong> a self-signed
                note is not sufficient</strong> as exams are <em>Major
                Scheduled Grading Events</em>. For this class, such
              events are the final exam, the two midterms, and quizzes,
              which will be given in class. </p>
            <p> For medical absences, you must furnish documentation
              from the health care professional who treated you. This
              documentation must verify dates of treatment and indicate
              the timeframe that the student was unable to meet academic
              responsibilities. In addition, it must contain the name
              and phone number of the medical service provider to be
              used if verification is needed. No diagnostic information
              will ever be requested. Note that simply being seen by a
              health care professional does not constitute an excused
              absence; it must be clear that you were unable to perform
              your academic duties. </p>
            <p> It is the University's policy to provide accommodations
              for students with religious observances conflicting with
              exams, but it is the your responsibility to inform the
              instructor in advance of intended religious observances.
              If you have a conflict with one of the planned exams, you
              <strong>must</strong> inform us prior to the end of the
              first two weeks of the class. </p>
            <p> For missed exams due to excused absences, the instructor
              will arrange a makeup exam. If you might miss an exam for
              any other reason other than those above, you must contact
              the instructor <strong>in advance</strong> to discuss the
              circumstances. We are not obligated to offer a substitute
              assignment or to provide a makeup exam unless the failure
              to perform was due to an excused absence. </p>
            <p> The policies for excused absences <strong>do not</strong>
              apply to project assignments. Projects will be assigned
              with sufficient time to be completed by students who have
              a reasonable understanding of the necessary material and
              begin promptly. In cases of <strong>extremely serious</strong>
              documented illness of <strong>lengthy duration</strong>
              or other protracted, severe emergency situations, the
              instructor may consider extensions on project assignments,
              depending upon the specific circumstances. </p>
            <p> Besides the policies in this syllabus, the University's
              policies apply during the semester. Various policies that
              may be relevant appear in the <a
					      href="http://www.umd.edu/catalog">Undergraduate Catalog</a>.
            </p>
            <p> If you experience difficulty during the semester keeping
              up with the academic demands of your courses, you may
              consider contacting the Learning Assistance Service in
              2201 Shoemaker Building at (301) 314-7693. Their
              educational counselors can help with time management
              issues, reading, note-taking, and exam preparation skills.
            </p>
            <h3>Students with Disabilities</h3>
            <p> Students with disabilities who have been certified by
              Disability Support Services as needing any type of special
              accommodations should see the instructor as soon as
              possible during the schedule adjustment period (the first
              two weeks of class). Please provide DSS's letter of
              accommodation to the instructor at that time. </p>
            <p>All arrangements for exam accommodations as a result of
              disability <strong>must</strong> be made and arranged
              with the instructor <strong>at least</strong> three
              business days prior to the exam date; later requests
              (including retroactive ones) will be refused. </p>
            <h3>Academic Integrity</h3>
            <p> The Campus Senate has adopted a policy asking students
              to include the following statement on each examination or
              assignment in every course: "I pledge on my honor that I
              have not given or received any unauthorized assistance on
              this examination (or assignment)." Consequently, you will
              be requested to include this pledge on each exam and
              project. Please also carefully read the Office of
              Information Technology's <a
					 href="http://www.nethics.umd.edu/aup/">policy</a>
              regarding acceptable use of computer accounts. </p>
            <p> Programming projects are to be written <strong>individually</strong>,
              therefore cooperation or use of unauthorized materials on
              projects is a violation of the University's Code of
              Academic Integrity. Both the person receiving assistance <strong>and




                the person providing assistance</strong> are in
              violation of the honor code. <strong>Any evidence</strong>
              of this, or of unacceptable use of computer accounts, use
              of unauthorized materials or cooperation on exams or
              quizzes, or other possible violations of the Honor Code, <strong>will




                be submitted</strong> to the Student Honor Council,
              which could result in an XF for the course, suspension, or
              expulsion. </p>
            <ul>
              <li> For learning the course concepts (including the
                programming languages), students are welcome to study
                together or to receive help from anyone else. You may
                discuss with others the project requirements, the
                features of the programming languages used, what was
                discussed in class and in the class web forum, and
                general syntax errors.  </li>
              <li> When it comes to actually writing a project
                assignment, other than help from the instructional staff
                a project must solely and entirely be your own work.
                Working with another student or individual, or using
                anyone else's work <strong>in any way</strong> except
                as noted in this paragraph, is a violation of the code
                of academic integrity and <strong>will be reported</strong>
                to the Honor Council. You may not discuss design of any
                part of a project with <strong>anyone</strong> except
                the instructor or teaching assistants. Examples of
                questions you may <strong>not</strong> ask others might
                be "How did you implement this part of the project?" or
                "Please look at my code and help me find my stupid
                syntax error!". You may not use any disallowed source of
                information in creating either their project design or
                code. When writing projects you are free to use ideas or
                <strong>short fragments</strong> of code from <strong>published</strong>
                textbooks or <strong>publicly available</strong>
                information, but the specific source must be cited in a
                comment in the relevant section of the program. </li>
            </ul>
            <p> <strong>Violations of the Code of Academic Integrity
                may include, but are not limited to:</strong></p>
            <ol>
              <li> Failing to do all or any of the work on a project by
                yourself, other than assistance from the instructional
                staff. </li>
              <li> Using any ideas or any part of another person's
                project, or copying any other individual's work in any
                way. </li>
              <li> Giving any parts or ideas from your project,
                including test data, to another student. </li>
              <li> Allowing any other students access to your program on
                any computer system. </li>
              <li> Posting solutions to your projects to
                publicly-accessible sites, e.g., on github. (Note that
                if you want to use Git, you can request free, private
                accounts from Bitbucket.) </li>
              <li> Transferring any part of a project to or from another
                student or individual by any means, electronic or
                otherwise. </li>
            </ol>
            <p> If you have any question about a particular situation or
              source then consult with the instructors in advance.
              Should you have difficulty with a programming assignment
              you should <strong>see the instructional staff in office
                hours</strong>, and not solicit help from anyone else in
              violation of these rules. </p>
            <p> <strong>It is the responsibility, under the honor
                policy, of anyone who suspects an incident of academic
                dishonesty has occurred to report it to their
                instructor, or directly to the Honor Council.</strong></p>
            <p> Every semester the department has discovered a number of
              students attempting to cheat on project assignments, in
              violation of academic integrity requirements. Students'
              academic careers have been significantly affected by a
              decision to cheat. Think about whether you want to join
              them before contemplating cheating, or before helping a
              friend to cheat. </p>
            <p> You are welcome and encouraged to study and compare or
              discuss their implementations of the programming projects
              with any others after they are graded, <strong>provided
                that</strong> all of the students in question have
              received nonzero scores for that project assignment, and
              if that project will not be extended upon in a later
              project assignment. </p>
            <h4>Course Evaluations</h4>
            <p> If you have a suggestion for improving this class, don't
              hesitate to tell the instructor or TAs during the
              semester. At the end of the semester, please don't forget
              to provide your feedback using the campus-wide <a
							       href="https://www.courseevalum.umd.edu/">CourseEvalUM</a>
              system. Your comments will help make this class better.
              CourseEvalUM is scheduled to be open between Tuesday,
              December 1 and Sunday, December 13, but this is subject to
              change by campus. </p>
            <h4>Right to Change Information</h4>
            <p> Although every effort has been made to be complete and
              accurate, unforeseen circumstances arising during the
              semester could require the adjustment of any material
              given here. Consequently, given due notice to students,
              the instructors reserve the right to change any
              information on this syllabus or in other course materials.
